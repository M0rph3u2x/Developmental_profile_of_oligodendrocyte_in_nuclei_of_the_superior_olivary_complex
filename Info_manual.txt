 Short intro
-----------------------------

As we live in times of high data output and analysis it is important to have tools
for reliable and fast data evaluation. We developed highly specific tools for processing
our SOC Oligodendrocyte data:

1) 1_ZOO_SOC_Oligos_Fig1b_Normalize_Cell_Data.R
2) 2_ZOO_SOC_Oligos_Fig1b_Average_Density_Grid_XLSX.R
3) 3_ZOO_SOC_Oligos_Fig3_Plots.R

The first two scripts process the cell position and region data in multiple steps
resulting in a two-dimensional cell density grid that was displayed in Figure 1b of 
our manuscript.

The third script processed the cell position and region data in order to get an
overview for the cell counts per section/age/region, area size (of each region per slice)
and the density ((cells per slice)/area [mmÂ²]). This information was displayed in figure 3.

R script manual
-----------------------------

In order to run the three R-scripts it is necessary to open them within the RStudio Editor
(https://posit.co/). The scripts can identify their location on the computer and will install
and setup all necessary functions automatically.


1_ZOO_SOC_Oligos_Fig1b_Normalize_Cell_Data.R
--------------------------------------------

This script normalizes the cell position data by using the ROI (region of interest) data for each region.
In a first step the cell position data (which is different from slice to slice) is normalized by defining the
lower left position of the ROI as 0 and the upper right position as the maximum distance. In a second step the
position data is converted in percentage values from 0 % (lower left position) to 100 % (upper right position).
Cell positions outside of the ROI are discarded as false position data. Accepted and discarded cell data (for all
regions, age groups and slices) are saved separately as xlsx files in the "fig1b_output" folder.

Run the script
--------------

In order to run the script it is necessary to open it with RStudio. The script is dependent on the input data
stored in the folder "fig1b_input". The file "Combined_ImageJ-data.csv" includes all cell position data, while the
file "ROI-data.csv" holds the region border data. It is important to not change the name of the files or change the
location. The R-Script based on its current location will search within the folder "fig1b_input" for the files.
To process the data press "Ctrl+A" (marks the complete R script) within the script and then execute the script by 
pressing "Ctrl+Enter". The R script will process the data, create a new output folder "fig1b_output" and store the 
resulting tables (1_Density_Plot_Normalized_data_pixel.xlsx, 1_Density_Plot_Discarded_data_pixel.xlsx) inside it.


2_ZOO_SOC_Oligos_Fig1b_Average_Density_Grid_XLSX.R
--------------------------------------------------

The second script will in multiple steps process the normalized position data (created within the first script).
In a first step the position data (X/Y_Percentage) of each cell is binned in 5 % steps. Creating a grid of 21
fields in x and y direction (21*21). We get 21 fields because a field is defined as "i=5; min <= i-5 and max < i"
which means a 21 field ranging from "100" to "<105" Percent (here only 100 Percent is relevant) is created.
The binned data is stored within the subfolder "fig1b_output\1_binned_data".
In a second step the binned data is further processed into averaged data. In this step all slice data belonging to the same
region and age group are clustered and the average sum (cells per binned field / number of slices) and
average ndensity ((cells per binned field/max cells per binned field)/ number of slices) is calculated.
The averaged data is stored within the subfolder "fig1b_output\2_averaged_data".
In a third step the averaged ndensity data created in the last step is extracted and plotted in a two-dimensional
control grid. The plots are saved in the subfolder "fig1b_output\3_average_plot".
Finally the averaged ndensity data is also saved as a 21*21 xlsx table and stored in the subfolder "fig1b_output\4_xlsx_grid".
Before using the data in our manuscript as figure 1b the ndensity data was further normalized into values between 0 and 1
(ndensity value [of age/region cluster]/max ndensity [of age/region cluster]). The last step was done manually and
the result was converted into our final figure using the software "IgorPro" (https://www.wavemetrics.com/products/igorpro).

Run the script
--------------

In order to run the script it is necessary to open it with RStudio.
The second script is a continuation of the first script and can only be executed after execution of the first
script. The first script will create important variables, such as the dataframe "DistancePlot.Table" which will
be used within the second script.
To process the data press "Ctrl+A" (marks the complete R script) within the script and then execute the script by 
pressing "Ctrl+Enter". It will create output data for every step:

1_binned_data    -> Normalised cell position data is converted in 5 % bins
2_averaged_data  -> The binned data is converted in age/region clustered averaged cell position data (ndensity)
3_average_plot   -> The averaged ndensity data is plotted for each specified region and age group
4_xlsx_grid      -> The plotted averaged ndensity data is saved as two dimensional 21*21 grid


3_ZOO_SOC_Oligos_Fig3_Plots.R
-----------------------------

This script summarizes for each region and age group the number of cells per slice, region size, cell density.
It creates a single overview file dividing the data in region specific data sheets. It also creates an overview
plot of all three categories similar to the one used in figure 3.

In order to run the script it is necessary to open it with RStudio. The script is dependent on the input data
stored in the folder "fig1b_input". The file "Combined_ImageJ-data.csv" includes all cell position data, while the
file "ROI-data.csv" holds the region border data. It is important to not change the name of the files or change the

To process the data press "Ctrl+A" (marks the complete R script) within the script and then execute the script by 
pressing "Ctrl+Enter". The R script will process the data, create a new output folder "fig3_output" and store the 
resulting tables (Fig3_Raw_data.xlsx, Fig3_Overview.pdf) inside it.
